        For those who risk their lives to protect our freedom, it is a selfless act of valor asking for nothing in return.<br><br>
        To honor and appreciate the members of our armed forces Inspire you to give service members thanks for their sacrifices.<br><br>
        To understand the military perspective The freedom and liberty we enjoy is much because of the brave men and women of the
         military who dedicate their lives to protecting the nation. Many have sacrificed their lives so that we can live in a free and prosperous society.<br><br>
         Military members sacrifice a lot for the rest of us, It takes a great amount of courage and sacrifice to do what our soldiers do.
         Many of these great men and women have families of their own who they have to leave behind as they go to defend their country.
